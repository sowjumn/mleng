ML Types: 

### Supervised Learning Algorithms:
* Regression: Given an input x and output y, Predicting continous values from infinitely possible number of values
    * x = feature/input
    * y = target/output
    * m = number of training examples
    * (x,y) = single training example
    * (x(i),y(i)) = ith training example 
    
* Classification: Predicting the item class/category 

### Unsupervised Learning Alogorithms:
* Clustering: Finding the structure in data
* Associations: Associating frequent co-occuring items/events
* Anomaly Detection: Discovering abnormal and unusual cases
* Dimensionality Detection 

### Installing Python and Jupyter Notebooks

1. Use pyenv
2. Install a particular python version `pyenv install 3.10.12`
3. Set that version to global `pyenv global 3.10.12`
3. List all python versions `pyenv versions`
4. Install jupyter notebook software with brew `brew install jupyterlab`
5. `jupyter notebook`
